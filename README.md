Dell DRAC KVM Launcher
=========

Fed up of logging into the DRAC web interface just to launch a KVM session?
This simple Go program should help ease the pain.

```bash
$ drac-kvm --help
Usage of drac-kvm
  -d, --delay=10: Number of seconds to delay for javaws to start up & read jnlp before deleting it
  -h, --host="some.hostname.com": The DRAC host (or IP)
  -j, --javaws="/usr/bin/javaws": The path to javaws binary
  -p, --password=false: Prompt for password (optional, will use 'calvin' if not present)
  -u, --username="root": The DRAC username

# Example using default dell credentials (root/calvin)
$ drac-kvm -h 10.25.1.100

This has been tested on the following Dell servers:

 * 11th Generation (eg: Dell R710 / iDRAC6)

 * 12th Generation (eg: Dell R720 / iDRAC7)

It requires that you have java installed on your machine (specifically the `javaws` binary).

Installing (via Go)
----

If you already have Go configured on your system then you can just run the following to quickly install it:
```bash
$ go install github.com/paulmaddox/drac-kvm
```

Installing (pre built binaries)
----

If you don't have Go installed already on your system, then included in this repository are some prebuilt binaries:

* [Linux 64bit](https://github.com/PaulMaddox/drac-kvm/blob/master/binaries/drac.linux_64bit?raw=true)

* [Mac OSX 64bit](https://github.com/PaulMaddox/drac-kvm/blob/master/binaries/drac.osx_64bit?raw=true)
